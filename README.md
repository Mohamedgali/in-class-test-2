This is a repo that contains my short bio for ITC 134 assignment 2 
Hello! My name is Mohamed, and I enjoy moonlight strolls on the red sea, white and red roses by the armful, and reading palms.

Just joking, I'm not a fan of any of those things. More seriously, I'm interested in learning about computers, Coding, and databases. That's why I roll into Seattle central college to pursue my dream. This is my second quarter, and it is just the beginning similar to a roller coaster, up and down, side to side, and upside down. Or maybe not?

My experience so far, has been delightful! Because it is very challenging and I'm learning new things about myself. For example, I'm learning how to work with a team and also, how to meet deadlines.
